# Omron LVS-95XX Database Analysis Library
This library allows the programmer to work with data generated by an Omron Microscan LVS-95XX series of handheld barcode verifiers by providing methods to connect and extract data from the LVS database. The methods in this library are intended to provide simple access to common verification data, without the need to understand the underlying database structure.
